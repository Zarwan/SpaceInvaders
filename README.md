SpaceInvaders
=============
Note: I made this a long time ago, so the code is pretty disgusting. The game is still fun though!

Space Invaders is a shooting game based on the arcade game of the same name. The user's goal is to achieve a high score by shooting as many aliens as possible and to collect powerups along the way. The game consists of 8 levels, the last of which has a special boss alien.

Pygame is also required to run the game. It can be downloaded here: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
